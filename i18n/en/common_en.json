	"common_what_is_bitcoin": "WHAT IS BITCOIN?",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_1": "Bitcoin is two things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using the Bitcoin network (the computer network).",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_2": "Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, the Bitcoin network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_3": "Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_4": "Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_5": "Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_6": "Governments everywhere can print more paper money, but no one can print more bitcoin.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_7": "You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_8": "If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.",
	"common_what_is_bitcoin_content_9": "Bitcoin is better money.",
	"common_bitcoin_volatile": "I HEARD BITCOIN IS VOLATILE. IS THAT SAFE?",
	"common_bitcoin_volatile_content_1": "In the short term, the exchange rate of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate. This is called volatility.",
	"common_bitcoin_volatile_content_2": "But the volatility you see on a day-to-day basis 'disappears' in the long term.",
	"common_bitcoin_volatile_content_3": "Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.",
	"common_bitcoin_volatile_content_4": "Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.",
	"common_bitcoin_volatile_content_5": "In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.",
	"common_bitcoin_afford": "I CAN'T AFFORD A WHOLE BITCOIN",
	"common_bitcoin_afford_content_1": "A dollar is made up of 100 cents. A bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.",
	"common_bitcoin_afford_content_2": "You donâ€™t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is $100,000 then $1 buys you 1,000 sats!",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked": "HAS BITCOIN EVER BEEN HACKED?",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_1": "You may have heard about a 'Bitcoin hack' online or on the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin network has been hacked. However, the Bitcoin network has never been hacked.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_2": "What's the Bitcoin network? Well, think of the Bitcoin network as train tracks. The trains riding on the train tracks of the Bitcoin network are Bitcoin transactions.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_3": "When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian (like FTX) getting hacked or going bankrupt.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_4": "Custodians are companies that hold your bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your bitcoin when the company mismanages it, steals it, or goes out of business.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_5": "This happened most recently with FTX..",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_6": "Everyone who trusted FTX with their bitcoin lost their bitcoin. Everyone who held their bitcoin in self-custody was completely unaffected by FTX. That is the power of bitcoin in self-custody: true control of your money.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_7": "Instead of leaving your bitcoin on an exchange or in a wrapper like an ETF, hold it in your own wallet for all the freedom benefits.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_8": "When you self-custody your bitcoin, your money is protected by the Bitcoin network. It's the most secure financial network in the world.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_9": "In self-custody, Sam from FTX can't steal your bitcoin from you.",
	"common_bitcoin_hacked_content_10": "The government can't print more bitcoin and cause inflation.",

	"common_bitcoin_energy": "WHY DOES BITCOIN USE ENERGY?",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_content_1": "Bitcoin uses energy to secure the network and protect your money.",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_content_2": "Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_list_1": "Bitcoin is the most secure financial network in the world.",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_list_2": "Bitcoin helps stabilize energy grids with bitcoin mining.",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_list_3": "Bitcoin reduces emissions from oil drilling.",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_list_4": "Bitcoin uses less energy than Americans use for Christmas Lights each year.",
	"common_bitcoin_energy_list_5": "Bitcoin is the greenest industry on Earth!",
	"common_cic_intro_1": "Many people know about Compound Interest, but few people know about Compound Inflation.",
	"common_cic_intro_2": "With our Compound Inflation Calculator, you can easily calculate the amount your salary needs to increase to maintain your purchasing power over time.",
	"common_cic_intro_3": "Simply enter your current salary, inflation rate, and the number of years you want to calculate for, and our calculator will show you what your salary needs to be to keep up with inflation.",
